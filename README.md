# LittleGameEngineTS - The Tiny Typescript Game Engine

This is a typescript port of [LittleJS](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS)

## Improvements over LitteJS

* robust compile step using typescript compiler
* modern module approach (umd module) instead of global space
* modern build pipeline using webpack
* type definitions when importing game engine - no more programming in the dark

## Drawbacks

* most of the types are still just: any
* does not receive upstream modifications anymore
* might be buggy (it was just a fun project after all)
* might kill your cat

## How to use

```
 npm install -s @knopkem/little-game-engine-ts
```

## Example Project
